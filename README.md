## Project (1)

### CSC 234: Data Structures Final Project

**This is an undergraduate project _for CSC 234: Data Structures_, It had to meet the following requirements:**

You will create a 2D game that meets the following conditions:

1. Your game must feature 2D graphics using JavaFX. They don't have to be fancy, but they should look "nice". Even some simple shapes in MSPaint can look nice and clean.
2. Your game must make appropriate use of at least one data structure from this class: ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, or a custom-built data structure of your own.
3. Your game must do something interesting involving the data structure. You should design your game with the data structure in mind, so that it is important to the game. 
4. Your game must make appropriate use of at least one class (in addition to the ones I have provided).
5. Your game must have a scoring system, and the score must be displayed on the screen.
6. Your game should be a game! It should be playable and at least mildly fun

This game was inspired by a game a simpler game I made in Scratch:

**The files for this project consist of:**

  a.*Game.java*
  
  b.*Play.java*
  
  c.*TaskMaster.java*
  
  d.*Sprite.java*
  
  e.*gfx(folder)*

**_Works by compiling all four classes and then running from Play, which is the main class._**

## Project (2) 

### Artificial Intelligence Project

**This is an undergraduate project for Artificial Intelligence:**

Neural Network for Object recognition.

This neural network uses object recognition to classify handwritten number as a digit between 0-9.

**The files for this project consist of:**

*NeuralNet.py*
